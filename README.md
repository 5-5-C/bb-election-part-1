## Overview
Bikini Bottom needs a new mayor. And its up to the brave students of Bitmaker to bring the vote to the people.

This assignment has two parts:
1. Listing out the current election results
1. Allowing the user to vote.

We'll provide you with a JSON api that'll give you the current election results, and allow you to submit a vote.  Its up to you to build a wonderful frontend for this API, and talk to it asynchronously.

Let's get started!
